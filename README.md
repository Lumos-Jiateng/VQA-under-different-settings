# VQA-under-different-settings
A mindspore implementation of our novel model to solve the VQA problem under limited computing resources setting.

We referred to mindsporeai for full implementations of Resnet and Bert architecture, and designed the other part of the models on our own.

For more details, please check the .pdf file for our ideas and implementations.

This is also the final project for ZJU NLP course. We ranked high in the evaluation stage.
